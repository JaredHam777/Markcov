Name:	Jared Hamilton

Challenges:
The biggest challenge was having to first look at the code and observe its functionality in order to know what/how to implement

Likes:
It was fun to do, good project idea

Dislikes:
The rubric was not specific (I don't think) on what we needed to do to the starter file (like add in classes).  
I had to find that in the source files themselves
